# Tap-Up-
IOS Game that I am in the process of finishing

# Gameplay
Basic concept of the game is that the player taps on the circle in order to make sure that it stays above the bottom barrier. 
As the player survives longer the game gets progressively harder until the user cannot keep the ball in the air any longer

# Current Bugs:
- Some errors with gaining power ups
- Second ball accidentally spawning on top of the current ball
- Gravity breaks if ball becomes trapped 

# Features to be added later:
- Additional power ups
- Different Game Modes
